Seminar 3
Obsolete software requirements are requirements that make it in the release planning but are not implemented because of various reasons[1]. 
Or as the author defined it: 
“An obsolete software requirement is a software requirement (implemented or not) that is no longer required for the current release or future releases and, 
for various reasons, has little or no business value for the potential customers or users of a software product.”
As the research suggest these type of requirements can have negative impact in different areas of a project. 
The method that is used to come to the results presented by the authors is a data collection by surveys of practitioners in the industry.
The interviewees come with experience from different development methodologies.
